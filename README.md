## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vite

This app was created using Vite + React. I used 3 React components for the image, main content and footer. I decided to separate it in this way to make sure each component was reusable. I specifically chose to put the image in its own component so that it can easily be imported and swapped out without interferring with any other parts. 

## Optimizations

I would love to add a feature where multiple users can login and customize the components themselves while using this template. Extra feature would be various multiple template styles. Extra feature would be dark/light mode switch. 

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first project I built in React which was super fun! I learned how to structure my files/folders to comply with React and the initial configuration with Vite was extremely easy and fast. I heavily enjoyed both React + Vite and plan to use it for all my projects moving forward. 

## Examples:
